The Authentication interface exposes the following methods:
authorities: collection of GrantedAuthority instances. Corresponds in most case to user roles
credentials: userâ€™ credentials (usually password)
details: object containing the details of the authentication process itself. The content of this object depends on the implementation of the Authentication interface. The default implementation returns null
principal: the principal object, which is most of the time an instance of the UserDetails interface
isAuthenticated: return true or false whether the use is authenticated or not
